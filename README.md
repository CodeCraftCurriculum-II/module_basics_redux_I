# Basics Redux

## Drive 
In this assignment your goal is always to get the car to the final flag. 
You have three functions (Lego blocks) to achieve this:

•	Move -> Moves the car 1 space in the direction it is heading. 
•	Turn -> Turns the car 90 deg clockwise. 
•	Peek -> Returns true if the next cell is open, otherwise false. 

Of course, you also have the option to use the other blocks from our syllabus to achieve your goal (variables, conditionals, arrays, loops and functions)

***Example:***

Possible  solution
```csharp
Move();
Move();
Move();
Turn();
Move();
Move();
Turn();
Turn();
Turn();
Move();
```

This is a labor-intensive way of creating the program, possible for small problems like this example, but exhaustive for the tasks ahead. So, dive into the toolbox (variables, conditionals, arrays, loops and functions).
